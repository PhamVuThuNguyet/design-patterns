# Design Patterns in Python

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in Python** repository! This project aims to demystify and demonstrate the use of classic design patterns in Python, providing you with clear examples and practical applications to enhance your software design skills.

## üìö Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They help you build scalable, maintainable, and robust applications. This repository covers a range of design patterns and shows how to implement them in Python, including:

- **Creational Patterns:** Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural Patterns:** Adapter, Decorator, Composite, Proxy
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Observer, Strategy, Command, State

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the examples and concepts in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhamVuThuNguyet/design-patterns.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd design-patterns
   ```

3. **Explore the Examples:**

   Each design pattern is implemented in its own Python file within the corresponding directory. Review the code, understand the implementation, and see how these patterns can be applied in different scenarios.

## üß© Patterns Included

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Builder:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- **Prototype:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### Structural Patterns

- **Adapter:** Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Decorator:** Adds behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- **Composite:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Proxy:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Command:** Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **State:** Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

## üìñ Documentation

Each pattern is documented with:

- A description of the pattern
- Pros and cons of the pattern
- Use cases and examples
- A Python implementation
